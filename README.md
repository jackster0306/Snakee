- **Start the Game** - Press the Play button to begin!




### Gameplay
Once the game starts, control the snake and try to achieve the highest score!
- Use the **arrow keys** or **WASD** to control the snake.
- Avoid **bombs** and **walls**‚Äîhitting them ends the game.
- Eat **food** to grow longer and increase your score.
- Be careful not to collide with yourself, or it's game over!

Depending on the theme selected, the game wil look different.

There are multiple levels to the game, as the snake gets long the level will increase, with a popup showing to alert you. Each level increases the speed of the snake and the spawn rate of the obstacles.
